3.5 Software System Attributes
3.5.1 Reliability
The system shall properly respond to a human players inputs at all times, and the game state will always remain correct and up to date on a human players client. In the case of unusual or unexpected errors the system shall be robust enough to handle them or fail gracefully. 

3.5.2 Availability
The availability of the client running on a players machine shall always be 100% assuming the client system has not undergone significant change since successfully running it initially. The server is an external factor that we can expect but not guarantee 100% uptime and availability on. This also assumes the availability of an internet connection on the client computer.

3.5.3 Security
The system shall use unique tokens, signatures, game ids, and passwords to ensure connection security. With those security measures in place the host can be confident in the fact that only those they invite can connect to the game.

3.5.4 Maintainability
The application will be built in a way that allows for minor extensions and future adjustments. Code will be well documented and coupling will be limited as much as possible to allow for easy reuse and refactoring. 

3.5.5 Portability
The application will be runnable on many systems with the ability to install Java Runtime Environment and by extension to run .jar files. The baseline will be the hardware in the Spinks computer laboratory machines and further system compatibility will be desired but not necessary.
