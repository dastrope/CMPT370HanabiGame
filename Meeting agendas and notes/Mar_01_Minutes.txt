Meeting Agenda for group G3

1. As a group we determined the entirety of fields and methods for the model, interaction model, view and controller for the main part of our game. 

2. We made sure everyone understood how the model, view and controller classes of our design interacts.

3. We still need to finish designing our classes and their methods for the menu.
