Working session

Worked together to stitch together the independent pieces of the requirements
document.  Worked together using Google Docs to collectively build on the same
document simultaneously.  Caught a couple of things we had missed, including markers
for other players' cards indicating what information has already been given.

There was candy.  It was good.
