Meeting Minutes for group G3

1. Discuss and decide on coding conventions. Earlier in the week the group agreed to look up coding conventions on our own time and share with the group. So far a few of us have read over and discussed the Oracle java convention but we will see if there are any alternatives presented at the meeting.

	- coding conventions chosen and up on GIT.  marked with a tag for marking.
	using the Oracle conventions.

2. Once we've decided on a convention we should work on turning it into something we can hand in as part of our coding convention assignment and commit to the git.

	- already done, the pdf is up

3. Now that we have our feedback for our requirements document we should discuss things our TA found lacking in our process or our product, and correct those issues.

	- by and large it was pretty good, precise commit messages
	
4. Aspect is sneaky, use it but also fix the design document
