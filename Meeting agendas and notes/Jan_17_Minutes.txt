Meeting minutes for group G3


TA running meeting anyway

1. "Hi, i'm _____"
	introductions, including areas of interest and focus
	
		- Joel - project manager / general design
		- Troy - Java, command line git comptence, Math minor
		- Oliver - generalist, comupter engineering
		- Dustin - less git, Java is a thing
		- Cole - confident coder, git, 

2. communications status
	get everyone onto the same system, Discord is already up and running
	check into getting git hook, if we think we need it
	
		- git hook probably not needed and likely more of a spambot than anything
	
3. time for TA (if needed)

		- MB is silly
	
4. double-check that everyone understands Hanabi, and what we need to do

		- check
		- requirements document will need executive summary (at the start)

-- time permitting... --
	
5. sort out a language in which to do the project
	based on what we have confidence in, and what fits well with the
	server code we're being given
	
		- Java is pretty much a given
		
		
6. general mockup of planned UI / features

		- make sure we're consistent with look when it comes to the requirements document

		
7. extra talking

		- aim for at least 2 meetings a week, we'll have to sort out a time that works
		- make sure that everyone gets a turn to talk
		- animation probably beyond our scope for now, but a possible stretch goal
