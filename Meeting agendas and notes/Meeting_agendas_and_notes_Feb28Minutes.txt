1. Team will meet at 1pm before our scheduled meeting with the TA to continue working on high level design interactions from our work session on the 26th. \

	- worked through some interactions between the model and view, 1:50 meeting talked breifly about subject/observer.
	
	- look up codesmells!  they'll help us work out where we might be making mistakes

2. Need to discuss observer pattern again because it has so far been left out of our class diagram, though we have discussed it previously.

3. Need to go through the class diagram that Kole made up and make sure everyone understands all interactions and the system so far makes sense.
