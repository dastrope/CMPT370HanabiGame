G13 Murray Library
Work meeting minutes - no agenda

- Talked about potentially adding a set of conventions used by other Hanabi players to a section of the rules, to allow for more advanced play - not yet ruled out or confirmed
- Discussed how intelligent the AI should be - may also consider using those conventions to tune AI play - still needs more consideration and research, hard to say if it would be worth doing
- Still need to do UI mockups for Tuesdays meeting
- Scrapped the idea of several difficulties with info flags disappearing after they are given, now only one standard difficulty which leaves all flagged information available to see at all times
- Went over actors/actions in the system, detailed use cases and a sort of outline for a sequence diagram with branches for actions occuring during a typical game, as well as some exceptions - decided on many of the post conditions for what the intended effects and considered some of the unintended effects of most game actions
- Will meet again on Tuesday, go over UI mockups and discuss requirements document more
- maintain communication on discord to ensure we are getting work done

- below is a recalling of some of the actions and game flow we discussed - Troy took notes as we went and will be posting them on git

Actors and actions
Actors
- Human player, AI player, Host, Server - might need more thought

Actions
Menu sequence
- create game, join game, rules

- create game - host creates a game lobby and allows other clients to connect through the server, host may choose to kick clients out of the game before it begins and must be the one to start the game once all clients are ready

- join game - clients enter a game number to connect to a host's lobby, can exit out at any time, must ready up for the host to start the game 

- how to play - brings up a pop up window with rules and pictures for the player to read, should not only list the rules but help the player understand how the game works with examples

Game sequence
- four actions available to players during the game (not including leaving the game)
on turn actions - play, give number info, give colour info, discard - must be taken on the players turn, when not their turn the actions will be unavailable or greyed out

- play - player may play any card in their hand - possible branches: play is successful, play is not successful - play success: card is added to the proper firework stack, new card is drawn to players hand if available - play fail: card is added to the discard stack, new card is drawn if available, fuse token is used 

- give _ info - once a type of info to give is selected players move their cursor over a card in another players hand, and all cards in that hand which match the attribute (number or colour) of that card will be raised (- _ - _ _ ) - once that info is given an information token will be used and the hint given about that card will be visible to all clients permanently

- discard - player may discard any card in their hand, but only if there are less than 8 info tokens available. if the discard is possible then the card is added to discard and an info token is regained 
view discard pile - this action can be taken at any time by all players - button is clicked to bring up a window where players can see all cards that have been discarded in an organized format (grid, rows - not clearly decided)

Game over sequence
- once the game ends, all players will be returned to the game lobby (connection will be maintained) a pop up window will appear with game score and fireworks display (potentially)
