Meeting Minutes for group G3

1. Inform - If the TA has anything to go over with us regarding issues
with our requirements document that will be first priority, need to know
if we're designing the right system before we can design it properly.

	- still not done being graded, may or may not be done before the
	design document is due.  May be good to look over the document
	ourselves.

2. Inform - Assuming no significant changes are necessary from TA feedback
if any is given, any additional information about software architectures that
members have learned should be shared. Any opinions for which we should go
with and why should also be discussed.

	- read over the design hand-in
	- hybrid architecture seeming likely at this point
	- ask an outside person if they could code something from our
	design graphs

3. Decide - Assuming again no significant changes and time allows, we should
decide on a software architecture and discuss how we will design our system
with it in mind. 

	- tabled until we can get the entire group together
	
	
	Additional time was instead used to talk about the midterm this evening.
