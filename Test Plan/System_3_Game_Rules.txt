Use Case 3: Reading the Rules (Requirements Document page 19)

Clicking the rules button should summon the rules screen, and clicking the "close" choice on the rules screen should banish it.  The rules will be in a separate window from the main game.

Test 1: Clicking the "rules" button on the main menu should bring up the Hanabi rules in their own window.  This will be a visual check.
