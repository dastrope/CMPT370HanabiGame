Use Case 1: Host a game (Requirements Document page 18)

Testing of UI elements on program boot will be mostly visual/manual tests to ensure that all required fields are on the screen.  Clicking the rules button should summon the rules screen, and clicking the "close" choice on the rules screen should banish it.  Clicking on the "host game" choice should bring up fields to fill in required information to launch a game on the server.

Test 1: A successful attempt to host a game will be when the server has returned the information for other players to join, and enough other players join that the game begins.

Test 2: If there is no connection to the server, the user should be informed of this and the menu should reset to its default state.

Test 3: If input to the text boxes is invalid, then the program should warn the user and prompt them to adjust their inputs.

Test 4: If the server informs the user that a game under the given NSID has already been created, it should pass this message on to the user and and ask permission to force the preexisting game to close.  If so, game should move to waiting for players to join phase.  If not, the menu should reset to its default state.
